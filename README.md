# odin-recipes

This is a project on [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com). It‘s my first project for this course.

In this project I have to create a webpage which contains lists, links, images, headers and text using HTML.

## Self Reflection

I’ve had some fun creating this project, I think I could have done this faster since it is a pretty simple and easy project. I didn’t really learn much from this project as I am already pretty good at HTML and using CSS, but I enjoyed working on this project.
